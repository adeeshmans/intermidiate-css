    <h3>Design & Development</h3>
    <p class="code-skill-discription">
     I first started web development during my summer internship with my university. I had applied for a student web dev
     position with very few experience with HTML and CSS. But I really enjoyed it learning the front-end on my own. Then
     I got more exposed towards the front-end through my classes at the university.

    <h3>Photography</h3>
    <p class="photography-skill-discription">
     I love Photography. I started to like photography during my sophomore year of college. I also have friends who were
     in the line of photography and videography, so thats what inspired this hobby of mine. I am still learning to take
     beautiful pictures with my friends and building connection by sharing my work to the world through Instagram.
